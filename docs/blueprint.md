# **App Name**: EcoSnap Recycle Guide

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Upload an image of waste material via a simple, intuitive interface.
- Waste Classification: Use an AI model (tool) to classify the waste material from the uploaded image. The tool will use reasoning to correctly identify the waste type from a set of possible classifications.
- Classification Display: Display the classification result clearly on the screen.
- Recycling Instructions: Provide recycling instructions based on the identified waste type, sourced from a pre-existing database or API.
- Feedback Collection: Include a user feedback mechanism (e.g., thumbs up/down) to improve the accuracy of the recycling information.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#388E3C) to represent sustainability.
- Secondary color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) for clean backgrounds.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and calls to action.
- Clean and modern sans-serif fonts for readability.
- Use clear and recognizable recycling symbols.
- Simple, card-based layout for easy navigation.

## Original User Request:
You are an AI assistant specializing in building ML models and apps. I need your help to create a waste classification and AI recycling instruction app. The app should utilize pre-trained models that have been trained on waste classification datasets of different categories. The interface should allow users to upload images of waste, identify the type of waste, and provide instructions on how to recycle them.

Research and list pre-trained models and datasets that specialize in waste classification.
Describe how to integrate these models into a user-friendly interface where users can upload images and receive recycling instructions.
Outline the steps for collecting and scraping web data to find the relevant models and datasets.
Provide best practices for ensuring the model accuracy and how to handle common issues like misclassification.
Please include detailed steps and tools needed for each part of the project.
